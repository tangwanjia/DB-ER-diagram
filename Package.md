Package

A shipping company ABC Courier offers the most efficient package delivery service by ensuring it can track the location and processing of every single package. They use a database system to store this information. In order to ship a package, customers drop off the package at a store location. The store must receive the packages and enter them into the system. The store can be described by store number, and location. The shipped packages are described by package number, delivery address, weight, dimensions, and delivery date. Once the packages have been entered, they will be transported to the delivery address, this can be through ground or air or a combination of both. To keep track of the packages during transportation, each transportation event is given a type (ground or air), route number and schedule number.
