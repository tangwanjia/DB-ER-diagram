Book

A book is identified by its ISBN number, and it has a title, a price, and a date of publication. It is published by a publisher, which has its own ID number and a name. Each book has exactly one publisher, but one publisher typically publishes multiple books over time. 

A book is written by one or multiple authors. Each author is identified by an author number and has a name and date of birth. Each author has either one or multiple books; in addition, occasionally data are needed regarding prospective authors who have not yet published any books.
